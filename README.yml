        For years, people have been trying to reduce their automobile
        insurance bills. Insurance companies claim that price will be
        reduced for good drivers and raised for bad ones. However,
        inaccuracies in their data predictions lead to the exact
        opposite. The dataset being used is released by Porto Seguro,
        an auto and homeowner insurance company from Brazil. It
        consists of information from several hundred thousands of
        policyholders.  The goal is to predict the probability an auto
        insurance policyholder files a claim the next year using
        classification algorithms. A good prediction with decent
        accuracy can correctly adjust prices for policyholders.
